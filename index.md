**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

We discovered the intuition behind way MPNNs fail to capture long-range interactions

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

We could potentially investigate graph transformer intepretability, and identify important subgraph structures on tasks with long-range interactions

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
We would add an additional intepretability layer on top of the graph GNN benchmarks done in Q1.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

We could potentially use GNNExplainer and explore other types of graph explainers.
